The project explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) to enable robotic arms to engage in dynamic sword-fighting scenarios, with one robot learning offensive strategies using a sword and the other defensive strategies with a shield. By leveraging techniques such as motion planning, trajectory estimation, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning, the robots are trained to perform real-time adaptive combat maneuvers. The methodology involves generating attack and defense paths using inverse kinematics and pre-training policies through imitation learning, followed by reinforcement learning for strategy refinement. The system incorporates continuous action and state spaces, with 28 parameters for state observation and 14 for action execution. This research advances autonomous robot-robot interaction in contact-rich, adversarial environments, with potential applications in autonomous security systems, sports robotics, and entertainment. Results demonstrate the successful implementation of basic offensive and defensive strategies, paving the way for further optimization of adaptive combat techniques through tailored reward functions.
